# ATTENTION ERA

A digital experience exploring the theme: "You are not the user. You are the used."

## About the Project

ATTENTION ERA is a glitchpunk sci-fi digital resistance web experience that mimics a cyber-cultic propaganda broadcast, revealing hidden truths about the attention economy and immersing users in a narrative about control and resistance.
